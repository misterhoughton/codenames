Sometimes, coders just want to put the computer to one side and kick back with their homies. But will their homies take them seriously if their name is 'Margaret' or 'Kevin' or something? 

Probably not. 

And who has time to come up with some ballin' gangster name? Nobody, that's who. 

That's why the modern programmer needs to leverage the awesome power of JavaScript and HTML in their pursuit of social respectability - gangsta style!

Either that or this might just be a dumb little repo for playing around with Git...
